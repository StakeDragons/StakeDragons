You accept and acknowledge: The value of digital assets including tokens is subjective. Prices of tokens are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money using the Service. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of tokens. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of tokens. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions. STAKE DRAGONS DEVELOPERS is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your use of the Service, including regarding tokens. There are risks associated with digital assets furnished by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with the Service. We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with, and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and STAKE DRAGONS DEVELOPERS has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain. There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that STAKE DRAGONS DEVELOPERS will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused. The Service might rely on third-party platforms, developers, and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers, developers, and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such third parties change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such third parties; or if any of such third parties loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer. Under no circumstances shall the inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against STAKE DRAGONS DEVELOPERS. If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE STAKE DRAGONS DEVELOPERS PARTIES FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.
